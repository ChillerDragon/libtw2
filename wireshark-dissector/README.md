wireshark-dissector
===================

1. Run `cargo build --release` to get a `libwireshark_dissector.so` (Linux),
   `libwireshark_dissector.dylib` (macOS) or `wireshark_dissector.dll`
   (Windows). On macOS, rename it to `libwireshark_dissector.so`, else
   Wireshark will not recognize it as a plugin.

2. Place the above mentioned file into your plugin folder, on Linux and macOS,
   it's `~/.local/lib/wireshark/plugins/4.0/epan/`, on Windows it's
   `%APPDATA%\Wireshark\plugins\4.0\epan\`. You'll likely have to create these
   folders.

3. Start Wireshark, go to Help â†’ About Wireshark, click on the Plugins tab. You
   should see the previously copied file in the list.

4. Start capturing Teeworlds traffic. It should automatically get dissected.
